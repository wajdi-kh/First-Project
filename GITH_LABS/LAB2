This project builds a supervised text classification model to predict whether an Amazon fine food review is positive or negative.
A review with a score of 4 or 5 is considered positive, while a score of 1 or 2 is considered negative. Reviews with a score of 3 are excluded to create a clear sentiment classification task.
